# The requirements
Create a dictionary which stores five key/value pairs.

Each key will represent a different box. In each key, store an arbitrary integer 
value (an amount of cash for instance).

Randomly choose a box for the user, display the value contained within, and 
ask them if they would like to stick with this box or pick another randomly 
selected box.

If they have a higher value in they box they chose in comparison to the other 
box, print a message stating that they have won. Otherwise print a message 
stating that they have lost
