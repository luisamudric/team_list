# The requirements

Ask a user to provide a list of names, the length of the list should be 
determined by the user input. Ask the user to indicate when the list is 
complete. 

Your program should then ask the user how many teams to separate these 
names into. Write a script which will randomly separate the names into the 
specified number of teams and print out each of these teams to the console. 

If there are any names left over after dividing the teams, print a message 
indicating how many names were left out and who they were.

For example, if the user inputs seven names and asks to separate these into 
two teams, they should be presented with two lists of three names 
(randomised) and a message explaining that there was one person left out as 
well as providing the name of that person.
